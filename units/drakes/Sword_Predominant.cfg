    description= _ "Originating in the art of weapon mastery, Drake Instructors have long been the tutors and teachers which have brought the Drake faction to such proficiency with such a variety of weapons. Mostly turning their back on their fire and flame origins these masters have perfected the wielding of giant swords and are revered by many in the Drake council room. Some, however, believe the taking up of human arms is a bane and disgrace to the Drake lineage. These talon wielders and burners look down upon the sword Drakes but no one has enough gall to look down on those legendary few who have taken this art to its peak."

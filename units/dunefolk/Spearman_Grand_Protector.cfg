    description= _ "Yet unreached by any known warrior under the desert sun, the idea of a Grand Protector was raised to the Eighth Sultan during the years of prosperity and plenty. He proposed a massive challenge that all the warriors in the land could undertake with the reward being appointed the first Grand Protector. Over the years the challenge stone still rests, somewhat worn away by the desert sands. A hero worthy has not yet shown himself, however. One day when that warrior comes, a warrior the height of Sebuleth and the strength of 100 bulls, with skill and dexterity and the ability to crush his enemies before him, he will take up the legendary banner and command a quarter of the army of the deserts."+{SPECIAL_NOTES_STEADFAST}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_INITIATIVE}
